#Prints a short story

print('Once upon a time, in the thrilling world of beige cubicles and lukewarm coffee, our hero, Bob, faced an insurmountable challenge: writing a short story. His heart raced as he pondered the many themes that could fit within the confines of a few paragraphs. Should he explore the existential crisis of a paperclip? Or perhaps the forbidden romance between two staplers?')
print('Bob’s fingers trembled over the keyboard, like a caffeinated squirrel attempting to compose Shakespeare. He typed, “In a land far, far away (but not too far, because we have a word limit), there lived a muffin.” Riveting, right? The muffin, named Crumby, dreamed of escaping its mundane existence as a breakfast pastry. It longed for adventure beyond the bakery aisle.')
print('however, Bob’s masterpiece concluded abruptly: “And then Crumby got eaten. The end.” A tear rolled down his cheek. Clearly, he had captured the essence of the human condition—the fleeting nature of existence—in just six sentences. Critics hailed it as “a literary marvel”')
print('And so, the next time you’re asked to write a short story, be like Bob, because if they wanted an author, they'd have found one.')
